# Daisy ðŸŒ¼

Daisy is a work-in-progress project to formalise some Kotlin inter-service messaging primitives that I've written a few times for different projects.

Producing and consuming messages in distributed or eventually consistent systems can be tricky, and must be built on fast, reliable, and tested foundations.

Kotlin, its standard library, and extension libraries (for coroutines and serialization) offer some excellent tools for server-side development, so we use those as the basis for the library.

The library will likely eventually be used and proved in production at [Adopt Animals](https://www.adopt.app), but it is developed independently of anything else, including Kale Charity and my employer.

## Project goals

* Limit scope to SQS and SNS support to begin with
* Limit scope to workers deployed as independently scalable processes, paired/deployed with a partner microservice (write vs read separation)
* Support the consumption of messages using coroutines: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines
* Support message routing and serialization helpers: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization
* Support composition of processors - e.g. applying or removing GZIP compression
* Support backoff strategies for scaling down processing of messages during slow periods
* Support changing message visibility to delay retries
* Support permanently failing the processing of a message, by delivering to a DLQ
* Gracefully scale to large amounts of messages (don't be the bottleneck)
* Include documentation, and an example project

### Code goals
* Keep unit test coverage high (~90%)
* Integration test using Docker Compose
* Investigate correctness testing with Lincheck: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-lincheck
* Investigate benchmarking tools (also Lincheck/JMH?)
* Try to keep dependency graph lean - if more systems are to be supported, consider subprojects and a BOM
* Do CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Running WIP Project

* Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
* Start `run/docker-compose.yml`
* Run `main` in `ApiPlayground.kt`
* The program will generate 10000 messages, then poll, process, and delete them all

Example output (connecting to real SQS):
```
messages.generated{queue=https://sqs.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/123/test-dlq} throughput=1690/s
messages.deleted{queue=https://sqs.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/123/test-queue} throughput=595/s
